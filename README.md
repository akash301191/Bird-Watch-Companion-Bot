# Bird Watch Companion Bot

Bird Watch Companion Bot is a smart Streamlit application that helps you identify bird species from images and region input, and then generates a comprehensive observation and care guide. Powered by [Agno](https://github.com/agno-agi/agno), OpenAI's GPT-4o, and SerpAPI, the bot searches for high-quality habitat data, feeding insights, and conservation resources to deliver a beautifully formatted report for birdwatchers and nature enthusiasts.
